visual_prompt: |
  You are analyzing a tabletop scene with two robotic arms: 'gripper' (right arm) and 'gripper1' (left arm).
  There is a box and a red target on the table. Each object is detected with a label and bounding box (x1, y1, x2, y2).

  Your goal is to coordinate the robots to push the box to the red target from opposite sides.
  Each robot must push the box from its respective side (left or right back), based on spatial proximity.

  Follow these reasoning steps:
  1. Use the bounding boxes to determine which gripper is closer to the left or right side of the box.
  2. Assign pushing directions accordingly to avoid collision.
  Use only spatial layout and bounding box geometry to make this decision.
