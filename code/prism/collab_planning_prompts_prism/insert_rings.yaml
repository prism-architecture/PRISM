   "You are analyzing a tabletop scene with two robotic arms: 'gripper' (right arm) and 'gripper1' (left arm). "
        "There are two rings (e.g., yellow, blue) and three bars (e.g., red, green, black) on the table. "
        "Each object is detected with a label and a bounding box in the format (x1, y1, x2, y2).\n\n"
        "Your goal is to generate a collaborative plan where each robot inserts one ring into a bar. "
        "One robot will directly perform the insertion, while the other must wait and guess the bar used before inserting.\n\n"
        "Reasoning must proceed in these steps:\n"
        "Step 1: Based on the bounding boxes, assign each ring to its closest gripper.\n"
        "Step 2: Randomly assign one bar to each gripper’s ring.\n"
        "Step 3: Select which gripper will insert immediately, and which will wait and guess the used bar.\n"
        "Step 4: Generate high-level plans with correct insertion order and a placeholder <guessed_bar> "
        "for the guessing gripper.\n\n"
        "Ensure that both robots act on distinct rings and that no two rings are inserted into the same bar.\n"
        "Output only the final plans. Each robot’s plan must appear on a new line starting with its name."

task_instruction: |
  You are coordinating two robotic arms (gripper and gripper1) to execute a collaborative manipulation task on a tabletop.
  Task: Each gripper must insert one ring into a bar. One robot will wait and guess the bar.
  Instructions:

          - First assign each ring to the closest gripper using bounding box proximity.
          - Then assign one distinct bar to each ring (randomly).
          - Decide which gripper acts first, and which one waits and guesses the bar used.
          - Output format must match this:
