visual_prompt: |
  You are analyzing a tabletop scene with two robotic arms: 'gripper' and 'gripper1'.
  The goal is to perform a horizontal handover of a single object (e.g., green block).
  The image provided is a front-view RGB image.

  Rules:
  - 'gripper1' will ALWAYS act as the giver.
  - 'gripper' will ALWAYS act as the receiver.

  You must reason about:
  - The giver gripper1 should pick and move the object to a handover pose
  - The receiver gripper should wait and grasp the object from that pose and move it away
  - Use the horizontal positions in the front view to confirm the expected roles.

  Output natural language high-level plans. Each robot gets one line, starting with its name.
