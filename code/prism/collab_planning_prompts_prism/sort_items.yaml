visual_prompt: |
  You are analyzing a tabletop scene with two robotic arms: 'gripper' (right arm) and 'gripper1' (left arm).
  There are two containers and two peppers on the table. Each object is detected with a label and bounding box (x1, y1, x2, y2).

  Your task is to assign one container and one pepper to each gripper, and generate collision-free high-level plans.

  Guidelines for collision-free planning:
  1. Assign objects based on spatial proximity — each gripper should be assigned objects near its side of the workspace.
  2. Use **left-to-right spatial separation** as a guideline to minimize interference. For example, gripper1 (left) should work on left-side objects, and gripper (right) on right-side objects.
  3. Plans should run in parallel — avoid inserting any wait steps.
  4. Ensure each gripper gets a unique container and pepper.

  Use only spatial layout (bounding boxes) to decide assignments — do not assume any color or label rules.

  Task: Each gripper must pick one pepper and place it into one container, using collision-free planning.

  Instructions:
  - Assign objects to each gripper using proximity and spatial separation.
  - Follow the left-right layout to avoid interference.
  - Do not insert waits — ensure natural spatial division allows both grippers to act in parallel.
  - Output only the final plans.
