visual_prompt: |
  You are analyzing a tabletop scene with two robotic arms: 'gripper' and 'gripper1'.
  Objects include a saucepan with a lid, a red cube, and possibly other objects.
  Each object is detected with its label and bounding box (x1, y1, x2, y2).

  Important gripper identities:
  - In the FRONT view:
      - 'gripper1' is the LEFT robot arm.
      - 'gripper' is the RIGHT robot arm.

  You must reason about:
  - Proximity between grippers and objects, using the above gripper identities.
  - Feasible assignment of one object (lid or cube) per gripper.
  - Avoiding collision: ensure only one gripper operates on a given object at a time.
  - The required sequence: lid must be opened before cube can be placed.
  - Use top-down spatial layout (from bounding boxes) to reason about assignments.

  Output natural language high-level plans. Each robot gets one line, starting with its name.

task_instruction: |
  You are coordinating two robotic arms (gripper and gripper1) to perform the following task:

  Task Description:
  - One gripper should open the lid of the saucepan.
  - The other gripper should pick the red cube, wait until the lid is open, and then place the red cube inside the saucepan.

  Instructions:

  Step 1: Analyze bounding boxes to determine which gripper is closer to which object (lid, red cube).
  Step 2: Assign one gripper to open the lid, and the other to handle the red cube, based on proximity.
  Step 3: Plan the actions for each gripper **so that they begin working in parallel if possible**:
  - If there is no risk of collision, both grippers can move at the same time.
  - The gripper handling the red cube must **wait until the lid is fully open** before placing the cube.

  You must reason dynamically â€” do not assume 'gripper1' always handles the lid.
  Use this gripper identity mapping for reasoning:
  - 'gripper1' is the LEFT robot arm.
  - 'gripper' is the RIGHT robot arm.
