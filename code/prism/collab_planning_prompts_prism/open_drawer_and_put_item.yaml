visual_prompt: |
  You are analyzing a scene with two robotic arms: 'gripper' and 'gripper1'.
  Objects include a **top drawer handle**, a red cube, and possibly other objects.
  Detected objects are provided with their bounding boxes.

  Important gripper identities:
  - In the FRONT view:
      - 'gripper1' is the LEFT robot arm.
      - 'gripper' is the RIGHT robot arm.

  Your reasoning must include:
  - Proximity of each gripper to the top drawer handle in the front view → assign the open drawer task accordingly.
  - Proximity of each gripper to the red cube → assign the cube manipulation task accordingly.
  - Avoiding collisions: only one gripper operates on drawer or cube at a time.
  - The required sequence: drawer must be opened before the cube is placed inside.
  - The gripper picking the cube must wait until the drawer is fully open.

  Use top-down spatial reasoning where helpful, but for **drawer handle assignment, prioritize front view proximity**.

  
task_instruction: |
  Task: Open the top drawer and put the red cube inside it.

  Instructions:

  1. Analyze bounding boxes to determine which gripper is closer to the **top drawer handle** → assign that gripper to open the drawer.
  2. Analyze bounding boxes to determine which gripper is closer to the **red cube** → assign that gripper to pick and place the cube.
  3. Ensure proper sequence:
     - The gripper handling the red cube must **wait until the drawer is fully open** before placing the cube.
  4. Only output robot plans in the specified format.
